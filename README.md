# physics

This repo will have a few assignments from my Physics 486 class at Western Washington University, Computational Physics in Python. In that class we explored methods like the Euler Step, Runge-Kutta, and other methods. The included assignments were some of my favorites that I decided to clean up and make more presentable.
